2- The revenue over the year 

Overall, the revenue line chart shows a positive trend, with revenue increasing steadily over the year. The highest revenue was generated in week 26, with revenue reaching $46,403,002. There was a slight dip in revenue in week 38, but revenue quickly recovered and continued to grow for the remainder of the year. The positive trend in revenue suggests that the business is growing and healthy. The slight dip in revenue in week 38 could be due to a number of factors, such as a seasonal decline in tourism,It is important to monitor the revenue trend closely to identify any potential problems and take corrective action if necessary.

3- The average price by of bedrooms

The average price per bedroom for a 4-bedroom home is $1,000, but there is a significant range in prices, depending on the size and location of the home.

4- The Distinct Count  of Bedroom Listings

This suggests that there is more competition in the market for 3 bedroom homes than for 1 bedroom homes. If you are investing in a hosting place, you may want to consider a 3 bedroom property if you are looking for a high occupancy rate. However, you should also keep in mind that you will need to charge a higher price per night to cover the costs of a larger property.

As you can see, the distinct count of listings decreases as the number of bedrooms increases. This is because there is less demand for homes with more bedrooms.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

1- Invest in a property in a popular tourist destination. Zip code 98146 has the highest average price per day, suggesting that there is strong demand for rental accommodations in this area.
Consider investing in a property with multiple bedrooms.

2- The average price per bedroom increases as the number of bedrooms increases, suggesting that there is more demand for larger properties.
Set your prices competitively.

3- The distinct count of listings decreases as the number of bedrooms increases, suggesting that there is less competition in the market for larger properties. You may be able to charge a higher price per night for a 3 bedroom property than for a 1 bedroom property.
  
4- Monitor the market closely. The revenue line chart shows that there can be fluctuations in revenue throughout the year. It is important to monitor the market closely to identify any potential problems and take corrective action if necessary.
